# Bitwarden: The Ideal Solution for Password Management

This repository contains an in-depth analysis and proposal for implementing Bitwarden as the primary password management solution at Northern Light Health Medical Center. The research paper highlights the increasing risks associated with unsecured password storage methods (such as sticky notes and text files) and how they can lead to data breaches and compliance violations. 

Bitwarden offers a secure, cross-platform password manager that ensures end-to-end encryption with AES-CBC 256-bit encryption, salted hashing, and PBKDF2 SHA-256. It is open-source, allowing transparency and community-driven improvements. The paper also emphasizes Bitwardenâ€™s additional tools like password generation and browser extensions, which support both personal and enterprise users.

The intended audience for this proposal is the Information Systems Management team at Northern Light Health, urging decision-makers to adopt this solution to enhance organizational security and compliance while safeguarding sensitive patient data.
